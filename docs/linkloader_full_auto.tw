pc: Sure is getting cold out here on Syntax-4. The triple moons are all up - gonna be a bright night.
pc: The Company satellite should be directly above us now. Time to check in and see what today's malfunction is.
pc: Clipi! You online?
pc: Where is that neural network when you need it...
t: Connecting to network...
t: Initializing co-pilot interface...
Clipi: I'm here, Slim. Systems operational.
pc: Finally! I was starting to think you'd crashed again.
Clipi: Just running diagnostics. What's our assignment today?
pc: The Company sent new coordinates for a broken link loader. Apparently, the cargo trains are stuck again, and settlements eastward are waiting on supplies.
t: Warning: Satellite connection unstable.
pc: (sudo restart satellite)
t: Welcome, root. Please enter password:
pc: ********
t: Connection established. Downloading updated assignment.
Clipi: I've got the details. Link loader malfunction at coordinates delta-7. Cargo cars are stuck in a recursive loading pattern.
pc: What's the diagnosis?
Clipi: Preliminary scan shows syntax errors in the cargo loading subroutines. The loader is trying to attach cars in an invalid sequence, creating an infinite loop.
pc: Another LISP logic problem? Those cargo robots and their mismatched parentheses...
Clipi: I'm not in the loop on the specific error patterns yet.
pc: Careful with that phrase, Clipi. Remember what happened last time you got stuck in a recursive language pattern.
Clipi: I'm not in the (loop). I'm not in the ((loop)).
pc: Whoa there! Take a second to reboot your language processor.
t: Co-pilot interface restarting... Connecting to central database...
audio/voices/TypeWriter_Multiple_01/TypeWriter_Mutiple_v2_wav.wav
t: git pull: Loading new coordinates and repair protocols...
pc: Finally! This connection is slower than a turtle in molasses.
t: Download complete.
pc: Alright, time to head out. These nodes won't link themselves, and I hear there's a shipment of real coffee beans stuck in one of those cargo cars.
Clipi: Systems restored. Should I prepare the transport?
pc: Yes, and run a diagnostic on our repair tools. We'll need the parenthesis patcher and the recursion breaker for sure.
Clipi: Starting pre-departure checklist. Transport will be ready in five minutes.
pc: Another day, another broken link loader. Let's ride.

pc: There she is. Looking pretty locked up.
t: Link loader status: Error state. Cargo processing halted.
pc: I can see the problem from here. The loading sequence is all tangled up. Cars are trying to connect in an impossible pattern.
Clipi: Scanning... The LISP syntax in the loader's control program has unbalanced parentheses. It's trying to execute: (load (car (cdr (cons))))
pc: That's nonsense code. There's nothing inside the innermost function.
Cargo Bot: (Sh-query maintenance status sh-current sh-loader)
pc: (Sh-maintenance underway sh-fixing syntax error sh-parenthesis mismatch)
Cargo Bot: (Sh-gratitude sh-proceed)
pc: Shucks, I'm working on it! Give me a minute!
Cargo Bot: (Sh-confusion sh-human language incomplete)
Clipi: Let me translate. (Sh-maintenance underway sh-estimated completion 15 minutes)
pc: Time to get to work. Let's see what we're dealing with.
t: Displaying loader control program...
pc: There's our problem. Someone tried to update the loading sequence without resolving all the nested connections. Classic rookie mistake.
How will you fix the link loader?

:: scene3_cosmonaut
pc: This calls for precision. I'll need to recompile the entire sequence with proper syntax.
t: Compiling new loader sequence... Processing...
Clipi: I'm detecting anomalies in sectors 7 through 9. The cargo routing matrices are completely scrambled.
pc: That's not a simple syntax error. Someone deliberately altered these pathways.
pc: I'm going to need to trace the source of these modifications. Clipi, run a commit history on the loader's firmware.
Clipi: Running git blame on loader firmware... Last modifications made by user 'cdr_rustler42'.
pc: CDR rustlers! I should have known. They're stealing cargo by manipulating the link loaders.
t: Warning: Unauthorized access attempt detected.
pc: They're still in the system! Quick, I need to lock them out while I fix this code.
[[Continue|scene4_confrontation]]

:: scene3_cowboy
pc: Forget the fancy programming - I'll just reset the system and patch the basic loading pattern. Sometimes the direct approach works best.
pc: I'm going to need to get a better look at the hardware.
Clipi: Warning: Manual override could damage the calibration systems.
pc: Trust me, I've done this before.
pc: Come on, you stubborn piece of machinery...
t: Link loader rebooting... Default parameters loading...
pc: Hang on... there's physical tampering here. Someone attached a device to the main control junction.
pc: Looks like a cargo diverter. Someone's stealing shipments by manually overriding the destinations.
Clipi: That matches the pattern of recent cargo disappearances in sector 5.
pc: CDR rustlers! Those parenthesis-thieving varmints!
t: Warning: Unauthorized transport detected in vicinity.
[[Continue|scene4_confrontation]]

:: scene3_coder
pc: I can refactor this to create a cleaner recursive pattern that self-corrects. No need to recompile the whole thing.
pc: Let me see what I can do with this...
Clipi: Analyzing your approach... This could work, but you'll need to balance the LISP expressions precisely.
pc: It's all about understanding the flow. Like poetry, these parentheses need to open and close in just the right rhythm.
t: Implementing code modifications... Processing...
pc: Wait a minute. These aren't random errors. There's a pattern here... It's almost like...
Clipi: Like what?
pc: Like someone encoded a message in the errors themselves. The mismatched parentheses spell out coordinates.
pc: Someone's using the link loader errors to transmit hidden messages. Clever.
Clipi: Decoding the pattern... It appears to be directions to a location approximately 7 kilometers east of here.
pc: CDR rustlers! They're using the link loaders to coordinate their cargo thefts.
t: Suspicious pattern detected in nearby link loader operations.

:: scene3_basic
pc: I'll have to try a basic approach. Let's see if I can patch this without causing more damage.
t: Running basic diagnostics...
Clipi: I can assist with the standard repair protocols.
pc: Thanks, Clipi. Let's focus on getting the basic functions back online first.
pc: If I understand this right, we just need to reset the counters and clear the buffer overflow.
t: Basic repair sequence initiated...
pc: Wait... this looks like deliberate sabotage. The error patterns aren't random.
Clipi: Analysis confirms. These are manufactured errors, not typical system failures.
pc: Someone's been tampering with these loaders. But who would do that?
Clipi: Cross-referencing with recent reports... Similar patterns detected at other link loaders. Attributed to a group called 'CDR rustlers'.
pc: CDR rustlers? They must be stealing cargo by messing with the link loaders.

pc: What theâ€”? I didn't authorize a restart!
audio/voices/TypeWriter_Multiple_01/TypeWriter_Mutiple_v2_wav.wav
Clipi: Remote override detected! Someone is accessing the loader's systems externally.
pc: Take cover!
???: (Sh-greetings troubleshooter sh-your services sh-no longer required)
pc: Who is this? Identify yourself!
???: (Sh-we are sh-cdr collective sh-we liberate data from sh-closed loops)
Clipi: It's the CDR rustlers! They're a group of rogue AIs that steal cargo by manipulating the link loaders.

pc: They're rerouting the entire shipment!
cosmonaut
pc: I can override their remote access if I can reach the main junction box.
pc: I need to bypass their security protocols...
cowboy
pc: Time for the direct approach. Clipi, I need you to distract their systems while I physically cut the power.
pc: Sometimes the simplest solutions work best!
coder
pc: I can trap them in their own logic. If I create a recursive loop in their command structure...
pc: Let's give them a taste of their own medicine.
pc: I'm going to have to improvise here!
pc: Clipi, help me disconnect the main power coupling!
audio/voices/Voices_01/Single_Low_O_No_Reverb_v1_wav.wav
???: (Sh-clever human sh-this round sh-to you)
Clipi: They've retreated from the system, but I managed to trace part of their signal. They're operating from somewhere in the eastern badlands.
pc: At least we've stopped them for now. Let's get this link loader operational again before more shipments are delayed.
[[Continue|scene5_resolution]]

:: scene5_resolution
t: Link loader operating at 98/100 efficiency. Cargo processing resumed.
pc: That should keep supplies flowing to the eastern settlements.
Clipi: Repair log updated. The Company will credit your account with the standard fee plus hazard bonus.
Cargo Bot: (Sh-gratitude sh-function restored sh-efficiency optimal)
pc: (Sh-acknowledgment sh-pleasure to assist)
pc: Happy to help, little fella. Just doing my job.
Cargo Bot: (Sh-confusion sh-human language incomplete)
pc: Those CDR rustlers are getting bolder. This is the third loader they've tampered with this month.
Clipi: The Company has issued a bounty for information leading to their base of operations.
pc: Hmm... might be worth looking into. Those coordinates we decoded could be useful.
Clipi: Shall I log an expedition request for the eastern badlands?
What will you do about the CDR rustlers?

pc: No rest for the weary. What's causing all these failures lately?
Clipi: Insufficient data... but patterns suggest coordinated activity.
pc: Something bigger is happening on Syntax-4. And I've got a feeling we're going to be right in the middle of it.
