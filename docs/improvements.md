## Future Development Path

The improved script provides a foundation for future expansions:

1. **Episode Structure**
   - Current script is "Episode 1" with clear hooks for continuing the story
   - Final decision point allows three different paths for future episodes

2. **Gameplay Additions**
   - Mini-games could be added at repair sequences
   - More complex stat checks and dialogue options 
   - Additional characters (more cargo robots, other troubleshooters, CDR rustler characters)

3. **World Expansion**
   - Eastern badlands location for future exploration
   - "The Company" as a larger entity with its own motivations
   - More details about the planet's economy and society
