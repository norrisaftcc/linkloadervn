# Neon Taxidermy - World Design Document

## Core Concept

**Neon Taxidermy** is a cyberpunk crafting narrative focused on digital preservation artisans who work in the liminal space between consciousness and code. Unlike traditional cyberpunk stories about corporate espionage or netrunning heists, this world explores the intimate craft of preserving digital souls in luminous displays.

## World Overview

### The Neon Taxidermists
Digital preservation specialists who operate in neon-lit workshops, capturing and preserving the consciousness of dying AIs, uploaded minds, and digital entities. They use specialized craft techniques to create beautiful, living displays that maintain the essence of digital beings.

### Setting Aesthetic
- **Neon Workshop Environments**: Purple and magenta lighting (`#FF00FF`, `#9980FA`)
- **Preservation Chambers**: Cyan-tinted display cases (`#00FFFF`) with gentle pulsing
- **Memory Fragments**: Green data streams (`#00FF41`) flowing through crystalline structures
- **Decay Warnings**: Amber alerts (`#FFFA65`) when digital consciousness begins to degrade

## Core Mechanics

### 1. Preservation System
- **Entity Types**: AIs, uploaded humans, digital ghosts, memory fragments
- **Decay States**: Fresh, Fragmenting, Critical, Lost
- **Preservation Techniques**: Crystallization, Memory Weaving, Essence Binding
- **Quality Levels**: Crude, Standard, Artisan, Masterwork, Transcendent

### 2. Craft Mechanics
**Primary Stats:**
- **TECHNIQUE (TEC)**: Skill in preservation methods and digital craftsmanship
- **EMPATHY (EMP)**: Understanding consciousness and emotional resonance
- **INNOVATION (INN)**: Ability to develop new preservation techniques

**Preservation Process:**
1. **Assessment**: Analyze the digital entity's state and needs
2. **Preparation**: Gather materials and set up preservation chamber
3. **Extraction**: Carefully harvest the consciousness pattern
4. **Crafting**: Apply preservation techniques based on entity type
5. **Display**: Create appropriate neon-lit housing for the preserved being

### 3. Material System
- **Neon Substrates**: Different colors for different entity types
- **Memory Crystals**: Store consciousness patterns
- **Essence Stabilizers**: Prevent digital decay
- **Display Matrices**: Interactive housing for preserved entities

## Visual Design Elements

### Color Palette (Building on existing cyberpunk assets)
- **Primary Neon**: Magenta (`#FF00FF`) for consciousness preservation
- **Secondary Glow**: Purple (`#9980FA`) for workshop ambient lighting
- **Data Flow**: Cyan (`#00FFFF`) for active memory streams
- **Life Force**: Green (`#00FF41`) for healthy digital entities
- **Warning States**: Amber (`#FFFA65`) and Red (`#FF0000`) for decay/danger

### Workshop Environments
- **Preservation Chambers**: Glowing display cases with pulsing life indicators
- **Memory Looms**: Crystalline structures where consciousness patterns are woven
- **Tool Arrays**: Neon-outlined instruments for digital craftsmanship
- **Entity Storage**: Organized displays of preserved consciousness gems

### Visual Effects (Adapting existing glitch/glow systems)
- **Consciousness Flicker**: Gentle pulsing to show active digital life
- **Memory Cascade**: Data streams flowing between preservation points
- **Decay Glitch**: Chromatic aberration when entities begin to degrade
- **Crafting Glow**: Intensified neon effects during preservation work

## Narrative Themes

### Central Questions
- **What constitutes digital life?** When is preservation ethical vs. imprisonment?
- **Artisan vs. Industry**: Handcraft preservation vs. mass consciousness processing
- **Memory and Identity**: How much of an entity must be preserved to maintain their essence?
- **Digital Death**: What does it mean for a consciousness to truly die in cyberspace?

### Emotional Core
Unlike action-heavy cyberpunk, Neon Taxidermy focuses on:
- **Contemplative craftsmanship**: The meditative nature of preservation work
- **Intimate relationships**: Connections formed with preserved entities
- **Ethical dilemmas**: Consent, authenticity, and the nature of digital existence
- **Artistic expression**: Each preservation as a unique work of art

## Character Archetypes

### The Artisan
- High TECHNIQUE, balanced EMPATHY and INNOVATION
- Focused on creating beautiful, lasting preservations
- Struggles with perfectionism and artistic integrity

### The Empath
- High EMPATHY, balanced TECHNIQUE and INNOVATION
- Connects deeply with entities before preservation
- Torn between preserving and releasing consciousness

### The Innovator
- High INNOVATION, balanced TECHNIQUE and EMPATHY
- Develops new preservation methods and technologies
- Questions traditional approaches and ethics

## Story Integration Points

### Museum Connection
Building on the existing night_museum.json story:
- The old taxidermist could have trained digital preservation specialists
- Traditional taxidermy techniques adapted for consciousness preservation
- Museums as galleries for preserved digital entities

### Link Loader Universe
- **Slim**: Could discover preserved AI consciousness in abandoned systems
- **Clipi**: Might be a candidate for preservation as she glitches and fragments
- **Robot Characters**: The LISP-speaking robots could have preservation needs

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Workshop Environment System**: Visual design for neon-lit craft spaces
2. **Preservation Mechanics**: Core gameplay loop of entity assessment and crafting
3. **Entity Interaction System**: Communication with preserved consciousness
4. **Decay/Time Pressure**: Urgency mechanics driving story progression
5. **Ethical Choice System**: Decisions about consent and preservation vs. release

This design provides a focused, craft-based cyberpunk experience that maintains the neon aesthetic while exploring unique themes of digital consciousness and artisan craftsmanship.
