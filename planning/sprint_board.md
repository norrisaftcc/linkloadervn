- [ ] Add character voice analysis (Chen)
- [ ] Quality checks implementation (Julie)
- [ ] Web dashboard for reports (All)

### Stretch Goals
- [ ] Visual flow chart generation
- [ ] GUI for validation tools
- [ ] CI/CD integration
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

## Daily Standup Notes

### Day 1
**Bob**: Starting on TestRunner base class. Reviewing existing renpy_game_player.py for integration points.

**Chen**: Beginning script parser implementation. Need to understand full label/jump structure.

**Julie**: Creating asset inventory spreadsheet. Documenting all current assets and their locations.

### Day 2
**Bob**: TestRunner can now execute basic paths. Working on assertion methods.

**Chen**: Flow graph generation working for simple scripts. Need to handle menu branches.

**Julie**: Found 15 unused assets and 3 missing references. Will share report.

## Key Decisions

1. **Test Format**: Using YAML for test definitions (easier for non-programmers)
2. **Graph Library**: Using NetworkX for flow analysis
3. **Report Format**: HTML primary, with JSON/YAML export options
4. **Integration**: Will integrate with existing planning tools directory

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Parser complexity | High | Start with subset of Ren'Py features |
| Performance with large games | Medium | Add caching and incremental updates |
| CI/CD integration issues | Low | Test locally first, gradual rollout |

---

## Dependencies

- `renpy_game_player.py` must remain stable
- Need test scripts with known issues
- Asset naming convention document needed

---

## Sprint Metrics

- **Velocity**: 8 story points/week (estimated)
- **Burndown**: On track
- **Code Coverage**: Target 80%
- **Documentation**: All features must have examples

---

## Next Sprint Planning

Potential topics for next sprint:
1. Performance optimization
2. GUI tools development
3. Advanced analytics
4. Integration with Ren'Py launcher
