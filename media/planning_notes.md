## backstory

That dream again...
Back to a world of quietly buzzing, clicking servers.
The gentle breeze from the server's cooling systems ruffles your hair playfully.
You sit up in your bed, which is (obviously) a packing crate stuffed with foam.
"always keep the packing crates. They're the closest thing to furniture on the planet."

You're in the same small room as always. (Well, it's a big room, but it's 97% occupied by servers.)
The room is filled with the gently twinkling lights of the server farms.
Your dictionary, the only book on this planet, is where you left it.
Your jacket lies over a nearby chair.

Item Acquired
You reach for the jacket, finding your badge underneath it.

Item Descriptiona dented and nicked titanium badge of office. The company's logo, $( ), is embossed above a small row of blinking lights.
