Slim: Sure is getting cold out here on Syntax-4. The triple moons are all up - gonna be a bright night.
Slim: The Company satellite should be directly above us now. Time to check in and see what today's malfunction is.
Slim: Clipi! You online?
Slim: Where is that neural network when you need it...
Terminal: Connecting to network...
Terminal: Initializing co-pilot interface...
Clipi: I'm here, Slim. Systems operational.
Slim: Finally! I was starting to think you'd crashed again.
Clipi: Just running diagnostics. What's our assignment today?
Slim: The Company sent new coordinates for a broken link loader. Apparently, the cargo trains are stuck again.

Slim: There she is. Looking pretty locked up.
Terminal: Link loader status: Error state. Cargo processing halted.
Slim: I can see the problem from here. The loading sequence is all tangled up.
Clipi: Scanning... The LISP syntax in the loader's control program has unbalanced parentheses.
Slim: That's nonsense code. There's nothing inside the innermost function.
Cargo Bot: (Sh-query maintenance status sh-current sh-loader)
Slim: (Sh-maintenance underway sh-fixing syntax error sh-parenthesis mismatch)
Cargo Bot: (Sh-gratitude sh-proceed)
Slim: Shucks, I'm working on it! Give me a minute!
Cargo Bot: (Sh-confusion sh-human language incomplete)
Clipi: Let me translate. (Sh-maintenance underway sh-estimated completion 15 minutes)
Slim: Time to get to work. Let's see what we're dealing with.
How will you fix the link loader?

Slim: This calls for precision. I'll need to recompile the entire sequence with proper syntax.
Clipi: I'm detecting anomalies in sectors 7 through 9.
Slim: That's not a simple syntax error. Someone deliberately altered these pathways.

:: scene3_cowboy
Slim: Forget the fancy programming - I'll just reset the system and patch the basic loading pattern.
Slim: Come on, you stubborn piece of machinery...
Terminal: Link loader rebooting... Default parameters loading...
Slim: Hang on... there's physical tampering here.
[[Continue|scene4_confrontation]]

:: scene3_coder
Slim: I can refactor this to create a cleaner recursive pattern that self-corrects.
Slim: Wait a minute. These aren't random errors. There's a pattern here...
Clipi: Decoding the pattern... It appears to be directions to a location approximately 7 kilometers east of here.

:: scene3_basic
Slim: I'll have to try a basic approach.
Clipi: I can assist with the standard repair protocols.
Slim: Wait... this looks like deliberate sabotage.

Terminal: Warning: Unauthorized activation sequence initiated.
Slim: What theâ€”? I didn't authorize a restart!
???: (Sh-greetings troubleshooter sh-your services sh-no longer required)
Slim: Who is this? Identify yourself!
???: (Sh-we are sh-cdr collective sh-we liberate data from sh-closed loops)
Clipi: It's the CDR rustlers!
cosmonaut
Slim: I can override their remote access if I can reach the main junction box.
cowboy
Slim: Time for the direct approach. Clipi, distract them while I cut the power!
coder
Slim: I can trap them in their own logic. If I create a recursive loop in their command structure...
Slim: I'm going to have to improvise here!
???: (Sh-clever human sh-this round sh-to you)
[[Continue|resolution]]

:: resolution
Terminal: Link loader operating at 98 percent efficiency. Cargo processing resumed.
Clipi: They've retreated from the system.
Slim: Those CDR rustlers are getting bolder.
What will you do about the CDR rustlers?
