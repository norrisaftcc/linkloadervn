[The Premise and Game mechanics]
You're a space cowboy, fixing broken link loaders. 
beware of cdr rustlers!

(cons car cdr) -> (car cdr)

(while next_cargo ( load ( cargo next) ) )

[You are a:]
Cosmonaut Cowboy Coder Person (CCCP)
aka (((P)))
*cue patriotic theme*
You have three stats:
- Cosmonaut - your skill with space stuff, high tech, using rayguns
- Cowboy - your skill with desert stuff, low tech, using shotguns
- Coder - your skill with robot stuff, communication, charisma, using terminals
- Person - uh... it's kind of your fourth stat, but you're the only creature on the planet who knows what a "person" is, so it's irrelevant

Robots have a LISP, by the way. It sounds like "(sh)", and it's how you say a parenthesis.
so (((P))) is "sh-sh-sh-p"
or "sh-while next_cargo sh-load sh-cargo next"
If you have low coder, you just say "shucks" a lot and never noticed parentheses.

Quick Character Creation: Pick One of these:

"Welcome Comrade" COS +2 COW -1 COD +2 -> You're from space, and you're here to help.
"Howdy Pardner"  COS -1 COW +2 COD +2 -> You ride the range, and you're here to help.
"Major Tom" COS +2 COW +2 COD -1 -> You were lost in space, and you just crashed here.

(if you want "derived" stats like many RPGs:
ST = Cos + Cow, DX = Cos + Cow, INT/WIS = Cos + Cod, CHA = Cod
HP = add up all 3 stats, then add 1 for Person.)
